The reason for creating this blog is to allow for me to properly outlay my
intentions throughout the development of a project or task. By doing that I
would want to achieve more clarity when writing or making decisions when
developing so I can later come back and use this as a reference for certain
design decisions.

The aim to is to document all my projects fully, but this depends on the
contenxt of project. In the case of developing propriety software/commerical
software less information will be given for the purpose of hiding client
information, but of course Open source projects can lend itself to full
discloure of what I'm doing. :triumph:
